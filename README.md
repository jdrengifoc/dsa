# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

In this repository applying the **Object Oriented Programming** paradigm, I code from scratch the data structures and algoritms (presented in the following sections) as packages of classes. Besides, I make unit testing with `unitroot` and `tox`.

## Data structures

1. [Linked Lists](src/linkedlist)
    - Stacks
    - Queues
2. Hash tables (in progress)
3. Trees
    - Binary tree: each node has at most 2 children.
4. Graphs

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description | Data Structure | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------|
|    pop    |             |      stack     |   $O(1)$   |
|    push   |             |      stack     |   $O(1)$   |
|    peek   |             |      stack     |   $O(1)$   |
|           |             |                |            |
|           |             |                |            |
|           |             |                |            |
