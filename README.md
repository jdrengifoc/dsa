# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

In this repository applying the **Object Oriented Programming** paradigm, I code from scratch the data structures and algoritms (presented in the following sections) as packages of classes. Besides, I make unit testing with `unitroot` and `tox`.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description | Data Structure | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------|
|           |             |                |            |
|           |             |                |            |
|           |             |                |            |
|           |             |                |            |
